100TB Backup Strategy w/ Triple Redundancy


Patrick Emerson
### create an archive strategy for backing up 100Tb of data with triple redundancy

An archive strategy with triple redundancy for backing up 100TB of data can be implemented as follows:

Onsite Backup: The first step is to have an onsite backup solution in place. This can be done using a network-attached storage (NAS) device or a storage area network (SAN) that is located within the same facility as the data source. This backup should be done on a daily basis to ensure that the data is always up-to-date.

Offsite Backup: In addition to the onsite backup, it's recommended to have an offsite backup in a remote location. This can be done using cloud-based storage solutions, such as Amazon S3 or Microsoft Azure, or by shipping physical backup tapes to an offsite location. This backup should be done at least once a week to ensure that the data is safe even in case of a disaster at the primary site.

Multiple Copies: To ensure triple redundancy, multiple copies of the backup data should be maintained. One copy can be kept onsite, another copy can be kept offsite, and a third copy can be kept in a secondary offsite location. This ensures that the data is always available and can be recovered in case of a disaster at one of the backup sites.

Testing: Regular testing of the backup and recovery process is critical to ensure that the data can be recovered when needed. This testing should be done at least once a quarter and should include restoring data to a test environment to validate the integrity and accuracy of the data.

Document: Finally, it's important to document the entire backup and recovery process, including the schedule, the locations of the backup data, and the procedures for restoring the data. This documentation should be updated regularly to ensure that the process remains up-to-date and that everyone involved in the process understands the steps required to recover the data in case of a disaster.

In summary, a triple redundancy backup strategy for 100TB of data involves daily onsite backups, weekly offsite backups, multiple copies of the data, regular testing, and detailed documentation.

Regularly remind users to move their own data to the main server. Send out emails, notifications, or pop-ups to remind users to back up their data. Encourage them to do it on a regular basis to ensure that their data is always backed up.

By following this five-step plan, you can automate moving files from the main server to the backup server while also empowering users to move their own data. This approach can help ensure that all data is backed up regularly, and that users are aware of the importance of backing up their own data.

why should I build my infrastructure based off of Linux and open source software, what are the problems with walled gardens and vendor lock-in

There are several reasons why you should consider building your infrastructure based on Linux and open source software, and why you should be wary of walled gardens and vendor lock-in:

Cost: Linux and many open source software solutions are free, which can be a huge cost savings compared to proprietary software licenses.

Flexibility: Open source software can be easily customized and integrated with other solutions, giving you greater flexibility and control over your infrastructure.

Security: Open source software is often considered more secure because the code is publicly available for review and can be audited by security experts.

Community support: Linux and many open source software solutions have large and active communities that provide support, documentation, and development resources.

On the other hand, walled gardens and vendor lock-in can present several problems:

Limited choice: Proprietary solutions may limit your choices for software, hardware, and services, forcing you to use a specific vendor's products.

Cost: Proprietary solutions often come with licensing fees, maintenance costs, and other hidden costs, which can be expensive in the long run.

Lack of control: Proprietary solutions can limit your ability to customize, modify, or integrate with other systems, reducing your control over your infrastructure.

Security risks: Proprietary solutions may have hidden security vulnerabilities or backdoors, and you may have limited visibility into how the software works.

In conclusion, choosing Linux and open source software can offer you greater flexibility, control, and security, while avoiding vendor lock-in and hidden costs. However, it's important to consider your specific needs and consult with experts to determine the best solution for your infrastructure.

how do I stop my drives from spinning in linux 

To stop your hard drives from spinning in Linux, you can use the hdparm command, which is a utility for manipulating various settings of ATA/SATA hard disks.

Here are the steps to stop your drives from spinning using hdparm:

Open a terminal window on your Linux machine.

Type the following command to list the hard drives installed on your system:

Copy code
sudo fdisk -l
Identify the device name of the hard drive you want to stop from spinning.

Type the following command to check the current power mode of the hard drive:

bash
Copy code
sudo hdparm -C /dev/sdX
Replace "/dev/sdX" with the device name of your hard drive.

If the hard drive is currently active, you need to stop all processes accessing the hard drive before continuing.

Type the following command to put the hard drive into standby mode:

bash
Copy code
sudo hdparm -y /dev/sdX
Replace "/dev/sdX" with the device name of your hard drive.

This command will stop the hard drive from spinning and put it into a low-power state. The hard drive will spin up again when accessed.

Note: This procedure should be used with caution as stopping the drives from spinning may impact the performance and lifespan of the drives. It's recommended to use this command only on drives that are not frequently used or when you need to save power.




Patrick Emerson
how would I write a script that would put all the drives that were formated exfat into sleep mode after 5 minutes of not being used
To write a script that puts all drives that were formatted as exFAT into sleep mode after 5 minutes of not being used, you can use a combination of the lsblk, grep, awk, and hdparm commands in a Bash script.

Here is an example script that you can modify according to your needs:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Set the number of minutes of inactivity before the drives go to sleep
SLEEP_TIMER=5

# Get a list of all the mounted exFAT drives
drives=$(lsblk -o name,fstype | grep exfat | awk '{print $1}')

# Loop through each drive and put it to sleep if it hasn't been used for the specified time
for drive in $drives; do
    # Get the last access time of the drive in seconds since Epoch
    last_access=$(stat -c %X /dev/$drive)

    # Get the current time in seconds since Epoch
    current_time=$(date +%s)

    # Calculate the elapsed time since the last access
    elapsed_time=$((current_time - last_access))

    # Put the drive to sleep if it hasn't been accessed for the specified time
    if [ $elapsed_time -ge $((SLEEP_TIMER * 60)) ]; then
        sudo hdparm -y /dev/$drive
    fi
done
This script first sets a variable SLEEP_TIMER to the number of minutes of inactivity before the drives go to sleep (in this case, 5 minutes). It then uses the lsblk command to get a list of all the mounted exFAT drives, and the grep and awk commands to filter out only the drive names.

The script then loops through each drive and uses the stat command to get the last access time of the drive in seconds since Epoch. It then calculates the elapsed time since the last access, and if it's greater than or equal to the SLEEP_TIMER variable (in seconds), it uses the hdparm command with the -y option to put the drive to sleep.

Note: This script requires sudo privileges to run, as the hdparm command requires root access. Also, please make sure to test this script thoroughly before using it on any important data, as putting hard drives to sleep can have unintended consequences.




Patrick Emerson
how could I write a service that would run that last script
To run the script as a service, you can use the systemd service manager. Here is an example of how to create a systemd service for the script:

Create a new file in the /etc/systemd/system directory with a .service extension, such as /etc/systemd/system/drive-sleep.service.

Open the file with a text editor and add the following lines:

ini
Copy code
[Unit]
Description=Drive Sleep Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/path/to/drive-sleep-script.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Replace /path/to/drive-sleep-script.sh with the full path to the script you want to run.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Run the following command to reload the systemd configuration:

Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Run the following command to start the service:

sql
Copy code
sudo systemctl start drive-sleep.service
This will start the service immediately.

Run the following command to enable the service to start at boot:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable drive-sleep.service
This will create a symlink to the service file in the appropriate directory.

The service will now start automatically at boot and run the script in the background. You can check the status of the service with the following command:

lua
Copy code
sudo systemctl status drive-sleep.service
This will show you whether the service is running, any error messages, and other details. You can also stop and restart the service with the systemctl stop and systemctl restart commands.




Patrick Emerson
how do I make that last service only run once a minute
To run the service only once a minute, you can modify the ExecStart line in the service file to include a delay. Here is an example of how to modify the service:

Open the service file with a text editor:
```
bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/drive-sleep.service
Modify the ExecStart line to include a delay:
```
javascript
Copy code
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'sleep 5m && /path/to/drive-sleep-script.sh'
This will wait for 5 minutes (300 seconds) before running the script.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Reload the systemd configuration:

Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart the service for the changes to take effect:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart drive-sleep.service
The service will now run the script once a minute with a delay of 5 minutes. You can adjust the delay by changing the time value in the sleep command.


sanoid and sincoid

Sanoid and Syncoid are two open-source utilities that are used for taking and managing ZFS snapshots.

Sanoid is a policy-driven snapshot management tool that is designed to make it easy to manage ZFS snapshots and replication tasks. It allows you to define snapshot retention policies, set up alerts, and schedule replication tasks. Sanoid is designed to work with Linux systems and it has a web interface called Syncoid Browser that makes it easy to manage ZFS snapshots and replication tasks.

Syncoid, on the other hand, is a simple command-line tool that is used for ZFS replication. It is designed to work with Sanoid, but it can also be used on its own. Syncoid is useful for replicating ZFS datasets to a remote server, and it supports incremental replication, which means that only the changes since the last replication are transferred. Syncoid is also designed to work with Linux systems and it can be easily integrated into your backup workflow.

In summary, Sanoid and Syncoid are two powerful tools that make it easy to manage ZFS snapshots and replication tasks on Linux systems. While Sanoid is a more comprehensive tool that allows you to define snapshot retention policies and set up alerts, Syncoid is a simple command-line tool that is useful for ZFS replication. They can be used together or separately to create a robust backup and disaster recovery solution.




Patrick Emerson
how do I move a zfs replication to a current working zfs pool
To move a ZFS replication to a current working ZFS pool, you can use the zfs receive command.

First, make sure the destination pool is set up and ready to receive the replication. Then, on the source system, you can create a new snapshot of the filesystem you want to replicate using the zfs snapshot command. For example:

java
Copy code
sudo zfs snapshot mypool/mydataset@replication
This will create a new snapshot called replication of the mydataset dataset in the mypool pool.

Next, use the zfs send command to send the snapshot to the destination system. For example:

perl
Copy code
```
sudo zfs send mypool/mydataset@replication | ssh user@destination-system 'sudo zfs receive newpool/newdataset'
```
.
This will send the replication snapshot of the mydataset dataset in the mypool pool to the newdataset dataset in the newpool pool on the destination system.

Once the replication is complete, you can then set up your system to use the newpool/newdataset dataset instead of the original dataset. This may involve updating configuration files or symbolic links to point to the new dataset.

It's also a good idea to test the new setup thoroughly to make sure everything is working as expected before removing the original dataset.

Note: Depending on the size of the dataset being replicated, the zfs send and zfs receive commands may take some time to complete. You can use the -v flag to get more verbose output and monitor the progress of the replication.




Patrick Emerson
in a disaster how do I use my backup zfs replicated snapshot as the new server
In the event of a disaster where your primary ZFS server is unavailable, you can use a replicated ZFS snapshot to restore your data on a new server. The exact process will depend on the details of your backup and replication setup, but here is a general overview of the steps:

Verify that your backup and replication systems are functioning properly and have up-to-date snapshots of your data.

Set up a new ZFS server or system with the same ZFS version and pool layout as your original server.

Create the ZFS datasets that you need on the new system. You can use the zfs create command to create new datasets or the zfs receive command to recreate existing datasets from the replicated snapshot.

Use the zfs send command to send the latest replicated snapshot to the new system. For example:

perl
Copy code
```
sudo zfs send mypool/mydataset@replication | ssh user@new-system 'sudo zfs receive newpool/newdataset'
```
This will send the latest replication snapshot of the mydataset dataset in the mypool pool to the newdataset dataset in the newpool pool on the new system.

Once the replication is complete, check that the data has been transferred successfully and that the permissions are correct.

Update any configuration files or other settings that reference the original ZFS datasets to point to the new datasets on the new system.

Once you have verified that everything is working as expected, you can shut down the old ZFS server and start using the new system as your primary server.

Note that depending on the size of your dataset and the speed of your network, the zfs send and zfs receive commands can take some time to complete. It's a good idea to monitor the progress of the replication using the -v flag and to plan for a potential downtime during the migration process.





State Machine Model.


Patrick Emerson
what is a state machine

A state machine is a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of a system by representing it as a set of states and the transitions between them. In a state machine, the system is modeled as a set of states, each of which represents a particular condition or configuration of the system, and the transitions between these states represent the actions or events that cause the system to move from one state to another.

State machines are used in a variety of applications, such as in computer science, where they are used to model the behavior of programs, in electronic circuits, where they are used to design digital logic circuits, and in control systems, where they are used to model the behavior of physical systems.

There are two types of state machines: finite state machines and infinite state machines. In a finite state machine, the number of possible states is finite, while in an infinite state machine, the number of possible states is infinite.




Patrick Emerson
is there a proper way to make a finite state machine in python

Yes, you can implement a finite state machine in Python. Here's a simple example of how to create a finite state machine in Python:

python
Copy code
class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.handlers = {}
        self.startState = None
        self.endStates = []

    def add_state(self, name, handler, end_state=0):
        name = name.upper()
        self.handlers[name] = handler
        if end_state:
            self.endStates.append(name)

    def set_start(self, name):
        self.startState = name.upper()

    def run(self, inputData):
        try:
            handler = self.handlers[self.startState]
        except:
            raise ValueError("Must call .set_start() before .run()")
        if not self.endStates:
            raise ValueError("At least one state must be an end_state")

        while True:
            (newState, inputData) = handler(inputData)
            if newState.upper() in self.endStates:
                print("reached ", newState)
                break  # reached an end state
            else:
                handler = self.handlers[newState.upper()]
Here, StateMachine is a class that represents the finite state machine. It has methods for adding states, setting the start state, and running the machine with some input data.

To use the state machine, you first create an instance of the StateMachine class, add states using the add_state method, set the start state using the set_start method, and then run the machine using the run method with some input data.

For example, let's say you want to create a simple finite state machine that recognizes strings of the form "abba". Here's how you could do it using the StateMachine class:

python
Copy code
def state_a(inputData):
    if inputData == 'a':
        return ('B', inputData[1:])
    else:
        return ('A', inputData[1:])

def state_b(inputData):
    if inputData == 'b':

fsm = StateMachine()
fsm.add_state('A', state_a)
fsm.add_state('B', state_b)
fsm.add_state('C', state_c)
fsm.add_state('D', state_d, end_state=1)
fsm.set_start('A')
fsm.run('abbabba')
In this example, state_a, state_b, state_c, and state_d represent the states of the machine. The add_state method is used to add these states to the StateMachine instance. The end_state parameter is set to 1 for the final state, state_d. Finally, the set_start method is used to set the start state to state_a.

The run method is then called with the input string 'abbabba'. The state machine processes this input string and outputs "reached D" indicating that the input string was recognized by the machine
