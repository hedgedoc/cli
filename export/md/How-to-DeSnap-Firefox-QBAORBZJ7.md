# How to DeSnap Firefox

Step 1: Remove the Firefox Snap by running the following command in a new Terminal window:

```
sudo snap remove firefox
```

Step 2: Add the (Ubuntu) Mozilla team PPA to your list of software sources by running the following command in the same Terminal window:

```
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
```

Step 3: Next, alter the Firefox package priority to ensure the PPA/deb/apt version of Firefox is preferred. This can be done using a slither of code from FosTips (copy and paste it whole, not line by line):

```
echo '
Package: *
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001
' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox
```


Step 4: Since youâ€™ll (hopefully) want future Firefox upgrades to be installed automatically, Balint Reczey shares a concise command on his blog that ensures it happens:

```
echo 'Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins:: "LP-PPA-mozillateam:${distro_codename}";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades-firefox
```

Step 5: Finally, install Firefox via apt by running this command:

```
sudo apt install firefox
```
As soon as the Firefox installation completes pop open the app launcher and click on the Firefox icon to launch a de-Snapped version you can pin to the Ubuntu dock.
